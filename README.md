# Atomik Controller README #

# Version 0.8 Alpha
By Rahim Khoja

The Atomik Controller manages automated and smart lights. Initially The Atomik Controller will manage Mi-Light brand lights and Remotes, but it will expand to other Atomik and third party smart devices. The goal is to create a drop in replacement for the Mi-Light wifi bridge, that breaks the zone and device limitations, while providing a more robust home lighting controller. The Atomik controller will boast a Web GUI for system management, a Nrf24l01+ 2.4 GHz transceiver for listening and transmitting, Mi-Light RF RGB remote compatibility, a Mi-Light Smartphone server emulator that allows use of the Mi-Light Smartphone app as a remote, an API for 3rd party integration, and a task scheduling system to control light zones. 

Hopefully in the future the Atomik Controller will add blue tooth connectivity, additional devices from a variety of manufacturers, Zigbee compatibility, Z-Wave compatibility, OpenHAB compatibility, a simple light io scripting interface, a fully documented API for 3rd party compatibility, and other types of devices and sensors. 



 **Features:**

 * Fully featured web administration GUI
 * Maximum of 65,280 uniquely addressable Mi-Light RGB Devices ( But an unlimited amount of Devices can be Synced to a single address ) 
 * Maximum of 65,280 uniquely addressable Mi-Light CCT Devices ( But an unlimited amount of Devices can be Synced to a single address ) 
 * Unlimited amount of Mi-Light Smartphone Remotes ( Secured by MAC Address )
 * Maximum of 256 Mi-Light RGB RF Remotes
 * Unlimited amount of Atomik API Remotes ( for 3rd party integration )
